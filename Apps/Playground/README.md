# BabylonReactNative Playground App

This is a new example app for BabylonReactNative, based on `react-native-test-app`.

It's still getting fully wired up as a replacement, so if you are seeing this message it means that it's not in its final form yet!

To run it (on an Android device):

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run android`

(assuming that you have your setup working for running [RN Android apps on device](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device?platform=android))
